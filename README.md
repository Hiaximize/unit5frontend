### Struggles

1. In the beginning I was pushing data to a DB collection called Members and trying to pull from one called Member
2. Getting the heroku hosted app to properly store information to the database

I bounced around too much from django, mern and nerds. I started thinking I wanted to be really good at something instead of trying to learn new things like django.
